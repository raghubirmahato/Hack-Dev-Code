# Shell

The services and events this area of Hack Dev Code adds to the Cordis context, generated from the source by `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`. The packages themselves are described in their own READMEs under `packages/`.

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — the language sides differ only in locale-specific paired document paths. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.shell` — `ShellExecutor` (abstract seam)

Abstract bash execution service. Subclass, implement the abstract methods, and load the subclass as a plugin — it registers as `ctx.shell` (one implementation per context; loading a second throws, which is cordis' standard duplicate-service behavior).

execute resolves with the process handle after preparation. "Foreground" is a property of what the caller awaits, not of the spawn — a caller that awaits ShellExecution.result ran the command in the foreground; one that keeps the handle ran it in the background. A caller that waits only for a while runs the command under `onExpiry: 'none'` and bounds its own wait; the handle stays valid after the caller stops waiting.

Implementations must honor these semantics:

- ShellExecution.result rejects only for infrastructure failures. Nonzero exits, timeout kills, and abort kills resolve with a descriptive result: first-cause `timedOut`/`aborted`, the spec's `timeoutMs` echoed.
- The handle is published after preparation. `done` settles at process close and never rejects; spawn failures settle as `killed` with the error on the read path, while `result()` carries the same failure as its rejection.
- `onExpiry: 'none'` arms no deadline; `'kill'` kills at expiry. Expiry during preparation returns a settled timed-out handle without output.
- ShellProcess.readOutput is incremental: consecutive reads never repeat output. Lossy reads report truncation and available spill files.
- A still-running process is stopped and awaited when its owning composition tears down. With the subprocess seam that boundary is `ctx.subprocess` disposal, so a process survives an executor-only reload.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Apply implementation-owned defaults and caps to a request before execution.
 * @param request - the caller's request; omitted fields get this
 *   implementation's defaults, capped fields are clamped.
 * @returns the fully-specified spec to hand to {@link execute}.
 */
abstract resolve(request: ShellExecRequest): ShellExecSpec

/**
 * Prepare and spawn the command under its resolved deadline.
 * @param spec - a resolved spec from {@link resolve}, never a raw request.
 * @returns the prepared handle, including its result projection;
 *   preparation timeout yields an already-settled handle with no output.
 * @throws on preparation failure or caller cancellation before process publication.
 */
abstract execute(spec: ShellExecSpec): Promise<ShellExecution>

### `ctx.shellEnv` — `ShellEnvRegistry`

Registry (`ctx.shellEnv`) for trusted, per-execution `DSH_*` variables. The namespace is rebuilt for every model shell call: ambient `DSH_*` values are discarded by the executor, then the registry's current snapshot is injected. Built-in shell facts remain owned by the registry itself while plugins can register additional, enumerable facts with effect-scoped disposal.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Register one environment contributor. Names and keys are unique; built-in
 * keys are reserved. Registration is disposed with the calling plugin fiber.
 * @param contributor - declared key ownership and per-execution resolver.
 * @returns the disposer that unregisters the contribution.
 */
register(contributor: BashEnvContributor): () => void

/**
 * Build the trusted `DSH_*` snapshot for one shell tool execution.
 * @param execution - the current tool execution.
 * @returns an immutable environment overlay containing built-ins and current contributions.
 */
collect(execution: ToolExecution): DshEnvironment

/**
 * Enumerate plugin-contributed variables without executing their resolvers.
 * @returns declarations sorted by environment variable name.
 */
list(): BashEnvVariableInfo[]
```
