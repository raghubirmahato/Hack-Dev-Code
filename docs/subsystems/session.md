# Session

The services and events this area of Hack Dev Code adds to the Cordis context, generated from the source by `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`. The packages themselves are described in their own READMEs under `packages/`.

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — the language sides differ only in locale-specific paired document paths. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.sessions` — `SessionStore`

In-memory session store (`ctx.sessions`).

Persistence is intentionally not implemented here — the agent lifecycle attaches a session-log writer to each published session's write handle; a session published outside that lifecycle persists nothing.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Register one event interpreter for live creation, restore, and fork.
 * Disposing the contribution makes sessions that used it refuse further derivation.
 * @param projection - pure definition owned by the event's plugin.
 * @returns the fiber-owned disposer.
 * @throws when another definition already owns this event type.
 */
registerMessageProjection(projection: SessionMessageProjection): () => Promise<void>

/**
 * Create a session owned by the calling fiber: disposing that fiber stops
 * event notification and removes the session from the store. `options.seed`
 * populates the session with a copy of those events (replay/fork);
 * `options.meta` attaches creation metadata (validated absolute `cwd`, seed
 * and parent lineage, and delegation depth) as the immutable
 * {@link SessionHeader} (the store fills `version`/`id`/`createdAt`).
 *
 * For an agent whose session must be torn down IN ORDER with its loop (so the
 * loop's final events are published before the store attachment ends), do NOT use this
 * — fold the session lifecycle into the agent's own effect via
 * {@link prepare} + {@link enter} + {@link announce} (see
 * `dsh-agent-loop`'s creation transaction).
 *
 * @param id - the session id; omitted, the store mints `session-<n>`.
 * @param options - seed events and/or creation metadata for the header.
 * @returns the live session, already entered and announced.
 * @throws if a session with `id` already exists, metadata is not a plain
 *   lossless-JSON record with valid scalar fields, or `meta.cwd` is a
 *   non-absolute path (storage backends key directories off it).
 */
create(id?: SessionId, options?: CreateSessionOptions): Session

/**
 * Build a session WITHOUT entering it into the store — validate the id/cwd and
 * construct the {@link Session} (with its immutable {@link SessionHeader}).
 * Pairs with {@link enter} + {@link announce}: a caller that owns a composite
 * `ctx.effect` (the agent factory) folds the session lifecycle into that ONE
 * effect so a fiber unload tears the session + agent down as a single ORDERED
 * chain rather than as racing sibling effects — which would remove the publication hooks
 * before the driver's closing events commit, dropping them.
 *
 * @param id - the session id; omitted, the store mints `session-<n>`.
 * @param options - seed events and/or creation metadata for the header. With
 *   `eventState`, every seed event is either independently owned or any
 *   shared value is deeply frozen; {@link Session.fromRestore} validates and
 *   adopts those values without copying or freezing them.
 * @returns the store-owned session, not yet entered and read-only until announced.
 * @throws if a session with `id` already exists, metadata is not a plain
 *   lossless-JSON record with valid scalar fields, or `meta.cwd` is a
 *   non-absolute path.
 */
prepare(id?: SessionId, options?: PrepareSessionOptions): Session

/**
 * Enter a session into the store: install the module-private
 * append publication hooks and add it to the store. Writes remain disabled
 * until {@link announce} completes successfully. Returns the DETACH
 * disposer (hooks + store removal). Does NOT emit `session/created` —
 * the caller yields this disposer inside its effect and THEN calls
 * {@link announce}, so a throwing `session/created` listener rolls the attach
 * back instead of leaking it.
 *
 * Re-checks the id for a duplicate: `prepare` and `enter` are public
 * cross-package primitives and a caller may interleave arbitrary work (or
 * another create) between them, so a stale prepared session must NOT overwrite
 * a live store entry of the same id — its detach disposer would later delete
 * the REAL session. The {@link create} convenience and the agent factory call
 * the two back-to-back so they never trip this, but the public API cannot
 * assume that.
 *
 * @param session - an unentered session; independent instances become store-owned.
 * @returns the detach disposer (publication hooks + store removal). When called from
 *   a synchronous `session/created` listener, removal and disposal wait until
 *   that creation dispatch unwinds.
 * @throws if a session with this id is already in the store.
 */
enter(session: Session): () => void

/** Emit `session/created` exactly once for an {@link enter}ed session (with
 * the carrier {@link enter} captured). Separate from {@link enter} so the
 * caller can yield the detach disposer first (rollback safety — see
 * {@link enter}). The Session remains read-only throughout synchronous
 * dispatch; successful completion enables appends. A failed announcement
 * leaves it read-only and cannot be retried.
 * @param session - the entered session to announce to listeners.
 * @throws if the session is not live or its announcement already began,
 *   including a reentrant call from a creation listener. */
announce(session: Session): void

/**
 * Dispatch the awaited `session/flush` durability checkpoint for `session`,
 * with the carrier captured at {@link enter}. THE flush entry point: the
 * store owns the carrier, so callers (the checkpoint policy's per-request
 * barrier, goal-round-driver's idle checkpoint, teardown drains, and consumers
 * that flush themselves before reading storage) must come through here
 * rather than dispatch a raw `ctx.parallel('session/flush', …)` — one owner
 * and one spelling.
 * @param session - the session whose buffered events must reach durable storage.
 * @returns whether at least one durability listener participated, after every
 *   listener has settled successfully.
 * @throws the first registered listener failure after every listener settles.
 */
async flush(session: Session): Promise<boolean>

/**

/**

 * `inheritedEventCount` counts only copied source events, excluding these closers.

<a id="sessioncreated--emit"></a>

#### `session/created` — emit

Read-only creation announcement after store entry. New events reject until every synchronous listener has returned successfully. A synchronous throw vetoes creation and rolls back with a paired disposal; detach requested during dispatch is deferred. A returned-promise rejection is logged but cannot retroactively veto this synchronous boundary. Scope-filtered dispatch (`@hackdevcode/dsh-scope`): agent-scoped listeners receive only sessions entered through that agent's context.
