# System prompt

The services and events this area of Hack Dev Code adds to the Cordis context, generated from the source by `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`. The packages themselves are described in their own READMEs under `packages/`.

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — the language sides differ only in locale-specific paired document paths. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.systemPrompt` — `SystemPrompt`

Registry service for the prompt inputs assembled before each model step.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Register an ordered prompt section in the calling context's scope. A scoped
 * section shadows a global section with the same name; duplicates within one
 * layer and non-finite orders throw. Registration and disposal emit
 * `system-prompt/change`.
 * @param section - the section to register.
 * @returns the exact Cordis effect disposer.
 */
section(section: PromptSection): () => void

/**
 * Resolve the centrally owned placement of a repository prompt section.
 * @param name - stable section placement name.
 * @returns the section's numeric sort order.
 */
getSectionOrder(name: PromptSectionOrderName): number

/**
 * Resolve the centrally owned placement of a repository runtime context.
 * @param name - stable context placement name.
 * @returns the context's numeric sort order.
 */
getContextOrder(name: PromptContextOrderName): number

/**
 * Register ordered dynamic context in the calling context's scope. Scoped
 * entries shadow global entries with the same name.
 * @param context - the context contribution to register.
 * @returns the exact Cordis effect disposer.
 */
context(context: PromptContext): () => void

/**
 * Suppress optional dynamic runtime-context contributions in the calling
 * context's scope without changing the services that own or enforce those
 * facts. Multiple suppressors remain independently disposable.
 * @returns the exact Cordis effect disposer.
 */
suppressRuntimeContext(): () => void

/**
 * Register a tool-schema provider in the calling context's scope. Global and
 * matching scoped providers both contribute; returning the reserved
 * {@link TOOL_ORDER_REST} name makes assembly fail.
 * @param provider - evaluated for each assembly with its context.
 * @returns the exact Cordis effect disposer.
 */
tools(provider: (context: AssembleContext) => ToolProviderResult): () => void

/**
 * Register a prompt variable in the calling context's scope. Scoped values
 * shadow globals; invalid or duplicate names throw. A provider may return
 * `undefined`, but rendering a section that references that value then fails.
 * @param name - the `[a-z][a-z0-9_]*` reference name.
 * @param provider - evaluated for each assembly.
 * @returns the exact Cordis effect disposer.
 */
variable(name: string, provider: (context: AssembleContext) => string | undefined): () => void

/**
 * Refresh accepted registered runtime facts for request admission. Contexts
 * added only by the assembly waterfall retain their accepted values. Current
 * suppression removes optional contexts, and missing required registrations
 * are restored in registry order. Sections, tools, and interpolation variables
 * retain the accepted assembly; their providers and waterfall do not rerun.
 * @param assembly - accepted assembly for this scope and step.
 * @param context - the same scope and current plugin-defined assembly fields.
 * @returns the accepted assembly with current runtime-context provider text.
 */
refreshContext(assembly: PromptAssembly, context: AssembleContext = {}): PromptAssembly

/**
 * Assemble global and scoped providers, detach tool parameters, apply
 * canonical ordering, then run the presentation waterfall. Scoped sections
 * and variables shadow globals. The waterfall's text is authoritative except
 * that an effective complete section is restored afterwards as the sole
 * prompt section; tool declarations stay provider-owned.
 * @param context - the optional scope, step tool set, and plugin-defined assembly fields.
 * @returns the post-waterfall assembly with ordered tool declarations and any complete prompt enforced.
 */

### `system-prompt/*` events

<a id="system-promptassemble--waterfall"></a>

#### `system-prompt/assemble` — waterfall

Presentation waterfall over assembled sections, contexts, and variables. Scope-filtered dispatch (`@hackdevcode/dsh-scope`): scoped listeners receive only that scope's assemblies. The returned text is authoritative; tool declarations remain provider-owned. A supplied signal controls only this explicit assembly request and must not be retained to control later turns. A registered complete section is restored after this waterfall, so listeners cannot add to or replace that scope's system prompt.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**

 * @param assembly - the mutable assembly built from registered providers.
 * @param context - the caller's per-assembly context.
 * @mode waterfall

<a id="system-promptchange--emit"></a>

#### `system-prompt/change` — emit

Emitted when any prompt provider changes. This registry notification is unfiltered because a global change affects every scope.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Emitted when any prompt provider changes. This registry notification is
 * unfiltered because a global change affects every scope.
 * @mode emit
 */
'system-prompt/change'(): void
