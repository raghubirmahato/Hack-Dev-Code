# PTC runtime

The services and events this area of Hack Dev Code adds to the Cordis context, generated from the source by `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`. The packages themselves are described in their own READMEs under `packages/`.

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — the language sides differ only in locale-specific paired document paths. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.ptcRuntime` — `PtcRuntime` (abstract seam)

Registers one `ctx.ptcRuntime` implementation. Program, budget, abort, and substrate failures resolve in PtcRunResult; only Service Definition contract misuse rejects. Implementations bridge structured-cloneable bindings, materialize each declared namespace rejection class, treat programs as hostile peers, isolate distinct state owners, and terminate and await in-flight runs during disposal.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Release an owner's retained environment and await its execution resources.
 * Stateless providers have no retained resources to release.
 * @param owner - The exact object supplied as the request's state owner.
 * @returns Completion after all owned execution resources have been released.
 * @throws When managed resource cleanup fails.
 */
release(owner: object): Promise<void>

/**
 * Resolve supported options and provider defaults before execution.
 * @param request - Program, bindings, cancellation and optional execution choices.
 * @returns Complete directory, deadline and supported authority for run.
 * @throws When an explicit choice is invalid or unsupported by this provider.
 */
abstract resolve(request: PtcRunRequest): PtcRunSpec

/**
 * Execute resolved inputs; program outcomes resolve as result fields.
 * @param spec - directory, deadline, program, bindings, cancellation and supported policy.
 * @returns Captured output and the execution outcome.
 */
abstract run(spec: PtcRunSpec): Promise<PtcRunResult>
```
