# User questions

The services and events this area of Hack Dev Code adds to the Cordis context, generated from the source by `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`. The packages themselves are described in their own READMEs under `packages/`.

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — the language sides differ only in locale-specific paired document paths. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.userQuestions` — `UserQuestionService`

`ctx.userQuestions`: validation plus the scoped answerer waterfall.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Answer a continued question. The reply is steered into the agent as a
 * user message whose source names the call; that message is also the
 * record that closes the question in the projection.
 * @param agent - Live root agent for the owning Session.
 * @param callId - Continued question identity.
 * @param answer - Complete structured answer batch, one item per question of the call.
 * @returns Whether the question is still continued; an accepted reply stays
 *   queued until the agent admits its user message.
 * @throws {UserQuestionError} `BAD_ANSWER` when the batch does not name each
 *   question of the call exactly once, or `REPLY_QUEUED` when a reply is
 *   already waiting for admission.
 */
@Remote answer(agent: Agent, callId: ToolCallId, answer: AskUserQuestionAnswer): boolean

/**
 * Let one answer UI hold a live timed wait. Closing the stream releases its claim.
 * @param agent - Live root agent owning the question.
 * @param callId - Foreground tool call to attach to.
 * @param signal - Remote stream cancellation, including Client disconnect.
 * @returns One Host-computed remaining duration, or no frames once the wait ended.
 */
@Remote({ mode: 'stream' }) async *attachWait(agent: Agent, callId: ToolCallId, signal: AbortSignal): AsyncIterable<{ remainingMs: number }>

/**
 * Foreground wait whose first settlement the Client decides: the Client
 * rejects with `ASK_TIMED_OUT` when its countdown ends, and this method maps
 * that code to the pending result.
 * @param request - Questions, live owner agent, and abort signal.
 * @param callId - Tool call identity the Client card is keyed by.
 * @param timeoutMs - Positive foreground wait in milliseconds.
 * @returns The answer when it arrives inside the window, otherwise a pending
 *   result, also when no connected Client claimed the request by the deadline.
 * @throws {UserQuestionError} `BAD_TIMEOUT` for a non-integer, non-positive,
 *   or oversized wait.
 */
async askTimed( request: AskUserQuestionRequest & { agent: Agent }, callId: ToolCallId, timeoutMs: number, ): Promise<TimedUserQuestionResult>

/**
 * Ask the scoped answerer waterfall and wait for the user's answer.
 *
 * When a caller supplies an agent, human interaction is valid only for the
 * exact live runtime root. Runtime ownership, not durable session lineage,
 * decides this boundary: an owned child has no human answerer and would
 * block forever, while a lineage-bearing session resumed as a new runtime
 * root may ask normally.
 *
 * @param request Questions, owner agent, and abort signal.
 * @returns The answer chosen or typed by the human.
 * @throws {UserQuestionError} code `ASK_ABORTED` when the supplied signal
 *   is already or becomes aborted, `CALLER_NOT_LIVE` when a supplied agent
 *   is not the registry's exact live instance, or `DELEGATED_CALLER` when
 *   that live agent is owned by another agent.

### `user-questions/*` events

<a id="user-questionsrequest--waterfall"></a>

#### `user-questions/request` — waterfall

Ask composed answerers for structured user input. Return an answer to claim the request or call `next()` to delegate. Scope-filtered dispatch (`@hackdevcode/dsh-scope`): agent-scoped listeners receive only that agent.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**

 * (`@hackdevcode/dsh-scope`): agent-scoped listeners receive only that agent.
 * @param request - pending user-question request.
 * @mode waterfall
