# Workspace

The services and events this area of Hack Dev Code adds to the Cordis context, generated from the source by `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`. The packages themselves are described in their own READMEs under `packages/`.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED cordis-surface (gen-cordis-catalog.ts) — do not edit between markers -->

<a id="cordis-surface"></a>

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — the language sides differ only in locale-specific paired document paths. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

<a id="ctxdirectorypicker--directorypicker-abstract-seam"></a>

### `ctx.directoryPicker` — `DirectoryPicker` (abstract seam)

Abstract directory-picking service. Subclass, implement `capability()`, and load the subclass as a plugin — it registers as `ctx.directoryPicker` (one implementation per context; loading a second throws, cordis' standard duplicate-service behavior). The capability object must be stable for the service lifetime: consumers may capture it across calls.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * The backend's interaction capability.
 * @returns the discriminated capability consumers switch on.
 */
abstract capability(): DirectoryPickerCapability
```

<a id="ctxdirectorypickercontroller--directorypickercontroller"></a>

### `ctx.directoryPickerController` — `DirectoryPickerController`

Host service backing the generated `ctx.remote.directoryPicker` namespace. The seam it exports is abstract and therefore never a Loader entry of its own, so this controller carries the wire verbs: one composed backend serves either the native chooser or the browse primitives, and a verb the composition cannot serve is refused rather than approximated.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Open the host's OS chooser for a Remote caller.
 * @param signal - caller lifetime; abort terminates the chooser.
 * @returns the chosen absolute path, or null when the operator cancels.
 */
@Remote('pick') async pick(signal: AbortSignal): Promise<string | null>

/**
 * List one directory level for a Remote caller's in-app browser.
 * @param path - absolute directory to list; absent lists the home directory.
 * @param signal - caller lifetime; abort stops the backend's scan instead of
 *   letting it outlive a disconnected caller.
 * @returns the level's listing with its ancestry.
 */
@Remote('list') async list(path: string | undefined, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<DirectoryListing>

/**
 * Create one child directory for a Remote caller's in-app browser.
 * @param path - absolute existing parent directory.
 * @param name - single non-blank path segment.
 * @returns the created directory's absolute path.
 */
@Remote('createDirectory') async createDirectory(path: string, name: string): Promise<string>
```

<a id="ctxterminalcontroller--terminalcontroller"></a>

### `ctx.terminalController` — `TerminalController`

Typed Remote control of transient Session-owned terminal processes.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Read the Session's current directory and terminal limits without filesystem validation or shell lookup.
 * @param agent - Session owner supplied by the Gateway.
 * @param signal - request cancellation.
 * @returns the logged current directory and terminal limits; retained terminals keep their own process directories.

@Remote environment(agent: Agent, signal: AbortSignal): TerminalEnvironment

/**
 * Discover installed shells in the Session's execution environment.

@Remote shells(agent: Agent, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<TerminalShell[]>

/**
 * List retained terminals without resolving or activating an Agent.
 * @param sessionId - displayed Session identity, including offline history.
 * @returns terminals retained for this Host lifetime.
 */
@Remote list(sessionId: SessionId): WebTerminalInfo[]

/**
 * Allocate a user shell once for a caller-generated identity, without Agent sandbox or approval restrictions.
 * @param agent - Session owner supplied by the Gateway.
 * @param request - initial dimensions and idempotency identity.
 * @param signal - allocation cancellation; committed terminals survive disconnection.
 * @returns the existing or newly committed terminal.
 */
@Remote async create(agent: Agent, request: TerminalCreateRequest, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<WebTerminalInfo>

/**
 * Retain an existing terminal for a window without activating its Agent or taking input control.
 * @param sessionId - owning Session identity, including an inactive saved layout.
 * @param id - retained Host terminal identity.
 * @param signal - physical Remote stream cancellation.
 * @returns a hold acknowledgement followed by an open lifetime stream.
 */
@Remote({ mode: 'stream' }) retain(sessionId: SessionId, id: WebTerminalId, signal: AbortSignal): AsyncIterable<TerminalRetentionFrame>

/**
 * Attach terminal input and output to one physical Remote stream.
 * @param agent - Session owner supplied by the Gateway.
 * @param id - terminal identity.
 * @param signal - attachment cancellation; the process remains alive and input is never replayed.
 * @returns screen recovery, output, writable state and provider-acceptance acknowledgements.
 */
@Remote({ mode: 'stream' }) attach(agent: Agent, id: WebTerminalId, signal: AbortSignal): RemoteStream<TerminalFrame, TerminalInput>

/**
 * Rename a terminal without changing its shell.
 * @param agent - Session owner supplied by the Gateway.
 * @param id - terminal identity.
 * @param title - nonempty display title, at most 120 characters.
 */
@Remote rename(agent: Agent, id: WebTerminalId, title: string): void

/**
 * Close an identity to future creation and kill its process range; repeated closes succeed.
 * @param agent - Session owner supplied by the Gateway.
 * @param id - terminal identity.
 * @returns after provider cleanup succeeds. A failure retains the terminal for retry.
 */
@Remote async close(agent: Agent, id: WebTerminalId): Promise<void>

### `ctx.workspaceController` — `WorkspaceController`

Host service backing the generated `ctx.remote.workspace` namespace.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Create or idempotently resolve one Workspace over an existing directory.
 * @param request - directory path to register.
 * @returns the Workspace and whether this call created it.
 */
@Remote('create') create(request: WorkspaceCreateRequest): Promise<WorkspaceCreateValue>

/**
 * Initialize or reuse the default Workspace during first-use startup. The
 * directory name is fixed, so the Host never renames or relocates an
 * existing default; its initial title is that same name, which browser
 * consumers label in the reader's language.
 * @param signal - caller lifetime; cancels native directory lookup.
 * @returns the durable Workspace, or undefined when first-use initialization is ineligible; creates no Session or message.
 */
@Remote('initializeDefault') async initializeDefault(signal: AbortSignal): Promise<WorkspaceValue | undefined>

/**

 */
@Remote('archiveSession') archiveSession(request: WorkspaceArchiveSessionRequest): Promise<WorkspaceArchiveValue>

/**

### `ctx.workspaceFiles` — `WorkspaceFiles`

Host Remote file reads and workspace directory observations over the composed filesystem.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Read one page of lines from a UTF-8 file readable by the filesystem backend.
 * @param workspaceFileScope - header-derived workspace root for the Session identity on the wire.
 * @param path - absolute path or path relative to the workspace root; files outside it are allowed.

/**

 * @param workspaceFileScope - header-derived workspace root for the Session identity on the wire.
 * @param path - target path, absolute or workspace-relative; relative to the base file's directory when provided.
 * @param options - optional base file and range; without a range the complete-file cap applies.
 * @param signal - caller cancellation.
 * @returns native bytes with the file's version and size at the preceding stat, byte offset, and EOF marker.

### `ctx.workspaceRegistry` — `WorkspaceRegistry`

Durable workspace registry. Startup waits for `sessionPersistence`, builds one canonical-cwd header index, and completes the one-time history bootstrap before the service becomes active. The persistence dependency is mandatory so an unavailable peer can never be mistaken for an empty history and commit the initialized marker.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Create or reuse a workspace for an existing directory. The fully qualified
 * path is canonicalized through `fs.realpath`; a relative, nonexistent, or
 * non-directory path rejects. Repeated calls for the same canonical path
 * return the existing entity without changing its title.
 * A newly created workspace is prepended to the durable registry order.
 * Different canonical paths may share a display title.
 * @param path - Existing directory to own, in a fully qualified path spelling.
 * @param title - Display title used only when a new record is created.
 * @returns the existing or newly durable workspace.
 */
async create(path: string, title?: string): Promise<Workspace>

/**
 * Initialize the default Workspace only while both the registry and Session
 * history are empty. Repeated requests reuse its durable identity; deleting
 * that registration permanently disables automatic creation.
 * @param resolveDirectory - resolve the absolute directory; called only for
 * eligible creation, inside the registry mutation queue. Missing directories
 * are created recursively before registration, and the initial title is the
 * requested directory's own final segment — not the canonical one, so a
 * symlink at that path does not retitle the Workspace after its target.
 * After resolution, caller cancellation does not roll back creation or registration.
 * @returns the initialized Workspace, or undefined when automatic creation is ineligible.
 */
initializeDefault(resolveDirectory: () => Promise<string>): Promise<Workspace | undefined>

/**
 * Look up a workspace by id.
 * @param id - Workspace id.
 * @returns the workspace, or `undefined` when unknown.
 */
get(id: WorkspaceId): Workspace | undefined

/**
 * Synchronous workspace projection in durable registry order. Every
 * entity's `sessionIds` getter is already filtered by the startup/live
 * canonical-cwd header index; this method performs no persistence reads.
 * @returns a fresh ordered array of workspace entities.
 */
list(): Workspace[]

/**
 * Delete one workspace registration while retaining its directory and every
 * session log. The durable order is updated before the table deletion; a
 * failed table write restores the prior order and keeps the entity
 * published. Unknown ids are an idempotent no-op for domain callers.
 * @param id - Workspace registration to remove.
 * @returns `true` when a record was deleted, `false` when it was unknown.
 */
delete(id: WorkspaceId): Promise<boolean>

/**

/**

 * activity rejects with {@link WorkspaceActiveSessionError} before anything
 * is written. With `stopActivity` the archive is written without an
 * activity check, and the `workspace/session-stop` providers are then asked
 * to stop the session's work: the durable archive set is what a provider's
 * `agent/pre-step` gate reads, so every wake the stops induce is already
 * blocked. Archiving drops the session's pin in the same durable write
 * (pinning and archival are mutually exclusive). An already archived id
 * resolves without writing, asking, or stopping.
 * @param sessionId - The session to archive.
 * @param options - Whether running work is stopped instead of refusing.
 * @returns resolution after durability and, with `stopActivity`, after every stop request was issued.

### `workspace/*` events

<a id="workspacesession-activity--waterfall"></a>

#### `workspace/session-activity` — waterfall

Ask the composed providers what still runs for a session before it is archived. A listener prepends its own SessionActivity entries to the result of `next()`; the registry's innermost callback returns an empty list, so a composition without providers archives freely. Any non-empty result refuses the archive without a write.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Ask the composed providers what still runs for a session before it is
 * archived. A listener prepends its own {@link SessionActivity} entries to
 * the result of `next()`; the registry's innermost callback returns an
 * empty list, so a composition without providers archives freely. Any
 * non-empty result refuses the archive without a write.
 * @param request - the session about to be archived.
 * @param next - delegate to the remaining providers.
 * @mode waterfall
 */
'workspace/session-activity'( request: SessionActivityRequest, next: () => Promise<readonly SessionActivity[]>, ): Promise<readonly SessionActivity[]>
```

Source: [`packages/workspace/workspace/src/index.ts`](../../packages/workspace/workspace/src/index.ts)

<a id="workspacesession-stop--parallel"></a>

#### `workspace/session-stop` — parallel

Stop a session's running work because the caller archived it with `stopActivity`; the archive set is durable when this dispatches. Each provider stops its own families — cancelling a turn, its subagent descendants, owned jobs, or active schedules — through the same cancel paths the user's own stop actions use, so the session log ends every open turn regularly and a later unarchive can continue the conversation. Listeners issue their stop requests without waiting for running work to settle; a listener may await its own durability barrier. A rejection is logged by the registry and does not undo the archive.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Stop a session's running work because the caller archived it with
 * `stopActivity`; the archive set is durable when this dispatches. Each
 * provider stops its own families — cancelling a turn, its subagent
