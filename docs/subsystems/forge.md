# Forge

The services and events this area of Hack Dev Code adds to the Cordis context, generated from the source by `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`. The packages themselves are described in their own READMEs under `packages/`.

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — the language sides differ only in locale-specific paired document paths. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.forge` — `ForgeService`

Registry of forge providers. Watchers of one change request share a single polling loop; each forge has at most one fetch in flight, which batches every due change request of that forge.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Register the provider of one forge family as an effect on the calling
 * fiber. Watches of that forge receive an `unavailable` failure when the
 * registration ends. Unregistering cancels and awaits its in-flight calls;
 * results from the withdrawn registration are discarded.
 * @param provider - provider to serve `provider.forge`.
 * @returns the disposer that unregisters the provider and waits for its calls to finish.
 * @throws when another provider already serves the same forge.

### `ctx.forgePanel` — `ForgePanelController`

Serves the forge panel. Following a Session inspects the checkout of its current directory read-only in the Session's execution world, recognizes the code host of the upstream remote or `origin`, probes sign-in for that host, and polls the Session's bound change requests through `ctx.forge` until the last follower of that Session leaves. A worktree request makes the panel create a branch and checkout through an optional `ctx.worktrees` and enter it while the Session's first message waits in the inbox, or at the first step proposal of a message no wait took. After a failed or stopped attempt the message keeps waiting for another attempt or for the request to be withdrawn. A message also waits while the worktree the Session works in is gone, until that worktree is checked out again or left for the source checkout. Changes to a Session's checkout run as Agent maintenance, so a message that arrives meanwhile waits for them.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Stream the panel state of a Session: the current state first, then each
 * later state. Intermediate states may be skipped when the reader is slower
 * than the updates. The stream ends when `signal` aborts or the Remote stops.
 * @param session - Session to follow.
 * @param signal - ends the stream.
 * @returns panel states in publication order.

 * log: loaded Sessions report their bindings, others the cached Session
 * summary, and a Session without one shows nothing until it is opened.
 * Closed requests are polled at the idle cadence so reopening is observed. The
 * stream ends when `signal` aborts or the Remote stops.
 * @param signal - ends the stream.
 * @returns frames in publication order.

### `ctx.forgeSession` — `ForgeSessionService`

Session-scoped change request bindings. The `forgeChangeRequests` projection derives them from `gh pr create`, `gh pr view`, `gh pr edit`, `gh pr checkout`, and `git push` results and from `plugin:forge-session/binding` records. After each push result, and when a caller reports the branch a Session works on, the service looks up open change requests whose head is that branch and records the unbound ones as discovered. Watching a Session polls its visible change requests through `ctx.forge`.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * List the change requests bound to a Session and not dismissed.
 * @param session - Session whose bindings are read.
 * @returns visible bindings in first-recorded order, each with its latest polling result.
 */
changeRequests(session: Session): SessionChangeRequest[]

/**
 * Bind a change request to a Session by URL, or restore a dismissed binding.
 * Appends a `track` record with the provider's canonical URL unless the
 * change request is already visible.
 * @param session - Session that receives the binding.
 * @param url - web URL of the change request.
 * @throws when no registered provider recognizes the URL.
 */

 * @param session - Session that receives the bindings.
 * @param remote - URL of the remote that holds the branch.
 * @param branch - branch name on that remote.
