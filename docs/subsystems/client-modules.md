# Client modules

The services and events this area of Hack Dev Code adds to the Cordis context, generated from the source by `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`. The packages themselves are described in their own READMEs under `packages/`.

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — the language sides differ only in locale-specific paired document paths. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.clientModules` — `ClientModuleRegistry`

The web plugin table service: incremental `dsh.client` scan + wire composition + bundle and package-asset route + index injection rows. Construction runs the activation scan synchronously — a malformed declaration or missing bundle among the already-loaded entries aggregates into one loud throw (FAILED fiber; the boot activation audit reports it).

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Current composed entry graph (stable object between changes).
 * @returns the graph served as `window.__DSH_BOOT__`.
 */
graph(): WebBootGraph

/**
 * Absolute path of an entry's client bundle.
 * @param id - entry id (package name).
 * @returns the path, or undefined for an unknown id.
 */
clientPath(id: string): string | undefined

/**
 * Serve an advertised revisioned bundle, source map, chunk, or package asset
 * without a Web server. Unknown URLs return 404, unsupported methods return
 * 405, and `HEAD` returns the same immutable headers without materializing a
 * body. Each bundle body is built once on its first `GET`; script
 * construction never reads maps. A package asset is read on every request
 * and answers 304 without a body when `If-None-Match` equals its entity tag;
 * its body holds the file open until the caller consumes or cancels it. A
 * bundle, map, or chunk body is the held buffer itself, not a copy, so a
 * caller must not modify its bytes.
 * @param request - shell-carrier request for a `/plugins` resource.
 * @returns the exact response also exposed by the optional Web route.
 */
async fetchBundle(request: Request): Promise<Response>

/**
 * Filesystem baseline captured before an entry's current bytes were read.
 * HMR compares it with the live files when installing a watch, so a write
 * between startup composition and watch installation cannot disappear into
 * the watcher's initial state.
 * @param id - entry id (package name).
 * @returns the path and baseline, or undefined for an unknown id.
 */
artifactBaseline(id: string): ClientArtifactBaseline | undefined

/**
 * Publish one completed bundle generation (the HMR watch's registration
 * hook; an entry restart publishes through reconciliation instead).
 * Unchanged mtime, ctime and size preserve the graph without reading the bundle.
 * @param id - entry id (package name).
 * @returns the current artifact rev, or undefined for an unknown id.
 */
rebuilt(id: string): string | undefined

/**
 * Subscribe to bundle rebuilds; fires when {@link rebuilt} changes a rev. A rev an
 * entry restart publishes reaches only {@link onGraphChanged} listeners.
 * @param listener - receives the entry id and its new bundle rev.
 * @returns the unsubscriber.
 */
onRebuilt(listener: (id: string, rev: string) => void): () => void

/**
 * Fires after any flush that recomposed the graph (row added/removed, or a
 * rebuilt rev change). Pull model: listeners re-read {@link graph}.
 * @param listener - notified with no payload.
 * @returns the unsubscriber.
 */
onGraphChanged(listener: () => void): () => void
