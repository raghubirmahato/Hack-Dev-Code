The services and events this area of Hack Dev Code adds to the Cordis context, generated from the source by `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`. The packages themselves are described in their own READMEs under `packages/`.

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — the language sides differ only in locale-specific paired document paths. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.web` — `WebRuntime`

The web access service. Registered as `ctx.web` (one instance per context).

Selection semantics (resolved at execution time, never order-dependent):

- A configured id that is registered and `available()` → that provider.
- A configured id not registered → `WEB_PROVIDER_CONFIGURED_MISSING`.
- A configured id registered but unavailable → `WEB_PROVIDER_CONFIGURED_UNAVAILABLE`.
- No id configured, exactly one registered usable provider → that provider.
- No id configured, multiple usable providers → `WEB_PROVIDER_AMBIGUOUS`.
- No id configured, no usable provider → `WEB_PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`.

/**
 * Register a search provider. Throws {@link WebError} `WEB_DUPLICATE_PROVIDER`
 * if its id is already registered for search. Returns a disposer; disposed
 * with the calling fiber.
 * @param provider - the provider; its `id` is the registry key.
 * @returns the disposer that unregisters the provider.

 * Register a fetch provider. Throws {@link WebError} `WEB_DUPLICATE_PROVIDER`

 * @param provider - the provider; its `id` is the registry key.
 * @returns the disposer that unregisters the provider.
 */
registerFetchProvider(provider: WebFetchProvider): () => void

/**
 * Run one search through the selected provider. Resolves the provider at call
 * time with the selection rules above; throws {@link WebError} when the
 * capability cannot run. The seam enforces `request.maxResults` on the result:
 * if the provider over-returns, `sources[]` is truncated and `truncated` set.
 * @param request - the query and optional result limit.
 * @param signal - optional cancellation signal forwarded to the provider.
 * @returns the provider's results, capped to `request.maxResults`.

 * model request on the `llmProvider` chat route. Asks only that provider's `ready()`;
 * one without `ready()` counts as ready. Makes no network calls. A selection failure
 * answers true, because `search()` reports that failure as a structured `WebError`.
 * @param llmProvider - the provider route id of the model request, when known.
 * @returns false only when the selected provider reports that it cannot authenticate.

 * @param request - the URL plus retrieval options.
 * @param signal - optional cancellation signal forwarded to the provider.
